# Methods for multivariate analysis

[Github Page](https://baltricks.github.io/mva/) of this repository.

This repository contains a collection of jupyter notebooks made while studying the following book:

<blockquote>
Klaus Backhaus, Bernd Erichson, Sonja Gensler, Rolf Weiber, Thomas Weiber <br>
Multivariate Analysemethoden <br>
Eine anwendungsorientierte Einführung <br>
16., vollständig überarbeitete und erweiterte Auflage 2021 <br>
Springer Gabler. ISBN 978-3-658-32424-7
</blockquote>


The notebooks contain much of the book's formulas, tables and graphs - translated to Python. 

There are no explanations from the book included. The only purpose was to familiarize with the topic and to implement the presented methods in Python.

All notebooks are stored in the directory *notebooks* with the cell output to show the results - so you can study them and there is no need to run them on yourself.

If you still want to run the notebooks you can use binder:
