In the jupyter notebook written for this chapter much of the chapter's formulas, tables and graphs are coded using the following Python modules: *math*, 
*pandas*, *numpy*, *matplotlib* and *scipy*.

Please note that this notebook does not contain any content of the book, but only serves to implement the methods in Python.

You can study the notebook for chapter 1 [in the repository](https://github.com/baltricks/mva/blob/main/notebooks/1_Introduction.ipynb) or run the notebook with binder:
