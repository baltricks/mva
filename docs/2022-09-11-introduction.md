The first chapter starts with an overview of the multivariate analysis methods that are described in the book.
After that, statistical parameters and the basics of statistical testing are discussed. The chapter concludes with the issue of causality (and correlation).


In the jupyter notebook written for this chapter much of the chapter's formulas, tables and graphs are coded using the following Python modules: *math*, 
*pandas*, *numpy*, *matplotlib* and *scipy*.

Please note that this notebook does not contain any content of the book, but only serves to implement the methods in python.

You can study the notebook for chapter 1 [in the repository](https://github.com/baltricks/mva/blob/main/notebooks/1_Introduction.ipynb) or run the notebook with binder:
